**Project Proposal**

With  the  technological advancement , urban planning, capturing city dynamics and intelligent route decision and prediction
have  attracted  fair  research  attentions. This leads to various interresting application including automatic navigation system , route prediction and efficient public transportation system. 

In this term project, we aim to address the problem of improper road infras-
tructure of urban areas leading to various problems of congestion, road-accidents etc.  The major challenge is to identify such problems from a given GPS footprints of a region.

The problem statement primarily includes detecting traffic / congestion level of  a  particular  city  region  in  a  given  time-interval.   For  example  , how  many vehicles are approaching towards park circus 7 point crossing?" 

The congestion level of an intersection point can be detected from GPS footprints of a region. Based  on  the  congestion  level  or  some  events  (ex.   road  blockage/  accident), other vehicles can be re-routed to avoid more transportationc problems.
