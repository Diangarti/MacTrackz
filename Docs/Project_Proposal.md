**Project Proposal**

With the major advances in big data and growing computing power, urban planning, capturing city dynamics and intelligent route decision and prediction have attracted fair research attentions. This leads to various interesting applications in navigation systems and map services like location based services,route prediction, traffic analysis and efficient public transportation. Also with the advent of emerging technologies like self-driving car, an efficient, fast and fault-tolerant route decision support system is needed. Also, identifying fast routes in transportation network is an challenging task in several navigation applications.

In this term project, we have addressed the problem of improper road infrastructure of urban areas leading to various problems of congestion, road-accidents etc. The major challenge is to identify such problems from a given GPS footprints of a region. The problem statement primarily includes detecting traffic/ congestion level of a particular city region in a given time-interval. For example “How many vehicles are approaching towards park circus 7 point crossing?” The congestion level of an intersection point has been detected from GPS footprints of a region. 

The novelty of our work is capturing dynamic nature of a road and inferring some decision. Based on these other vehicles can be re-routed to avoid more traffic problems or a recommendation system can be built which will notify major traffic intersection points of a road network.
